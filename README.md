# postfix

A simple stack language.

Based on the Postfix language described in 'Design Concepts and Programming
Languages' by Franklyn Turbak and David Gifford (with Mark A. Sheldon).

The Postfix language is described in the text above, this repository holds an
interpreter for parsing and executing the Postfix language.

Written in Rust because why not.

Happy hacking
